TODO:
Add more hexes.
Add selection of hexes
Use wavefunction colapse to generate maps

First step is to spawn a hex using the prototype
create a function called spawn_hex or something
Create a list or map with the prototypes
It should be able to map between a name and the hex, and we should be able to get the sockets it has avaiblie


Lav test af possiblity thingy.
